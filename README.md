# Enhancing Geotechnical Analysis with Deep Learning

Welcome to our project repository! Here, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of geotechnical research by applying advanced deep learning techniques. Our goal is to make the code and models available to the community to foster improved applications of deep learning in geotechnical engineering and to inspire further research in this vital field.

# Overlapping Local Self-Attention Transformers for Spatial Sequential Analysis in CPT Data

This repository hosts the Overlapping Local Self-Attention Transformer, crafted to boost spatial sequential analysis and reliability assessment in Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data. Our model introduces a unique take on self-attention mechanisms by emphasizing local sequence relationships, which offers a substantial enhancement over traditional global self-attention transformers for CPT-like data scenarios. Please note that the run.py file will be uploaded once the model is fully published.

## Visualizing the Model Architecture
To see a clear visualization of the model's architecture:

1. **Download the .pth file**: This file contains the model's weights and state, essential for running the model.
2. **Upload this file to [Netron](https://netron.app/)**: Netron is an online tool that allows you to view the internal structure of the model. Simply upload the `.pth` file to explore its architecture interactively.
