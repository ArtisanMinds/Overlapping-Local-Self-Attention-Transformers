# Overlapping Local Self-Attention Transformers for Spatial Sequential Analysis in CPT Data

This repository contains the code of the Overlapping Local Self-Attention Transformer, specifically designed to enhance spatial sequential analysis and reliability assessment in Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data. Our model leverages a novel approach to self-attention mechanisms, focusing on local sequence relationships, providing significant improvements over traditional global self-attention transformers in processing CPT-like data.

## Acknowledgements

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Simon Oberhollenzer, Michael Premstaller, Roman Marte, Franz Tschuchnigg, Georg H. Erharter, and Thomas Marcher for making the Cone Penetration Test dataset from Premstaller Geotechnik publicly available. Their contributions have been invaluable to the advancement of this research.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project originates from the Cone Penetration Test dataset provided by Premstaller Geotechnik. It encompasses a comprehensive range of geotechnical parameters obtained from cone penetration testing, offering a rich foundation for our analysis and model validation.
